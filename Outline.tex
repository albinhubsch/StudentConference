%Adapted for usage in Student Conference course by jubo (050118).
%Optimized for usage with pdflatex. For usage with plain latex,
%figures must be in Postscript (.ps or .eps files) and additional
%packages must be imported.

%This template works for outline and annotated bibliography
%(deliverable 2) without any changes.
%For usage with full and final papers (deliverables 3 and 4a/b)
%you must make several changes. All necessary changes are
%described in three specific commented sections preceded by
%`%%%%% BEGIN OF ADJUSTMENTS SECTION %%%%%'.
%The changes are in order of appearance:
%   - adjust the `\documentclass' command
%   - uncomment the abstract section
%   - adjust the `\bibliographystyle' command

%%%%% BEGIN OF 1st ADJUSTMENTS SECTION %%%%%
% You must use only one of the following `\documentclass' commands
% For the outline and annotated bibliography (deliverable 2)
% you must use the following command:
%
\documentclass[runningheads,a4paper,oribibl]{llncs}
%
% For the full and final paper (deliverables 3 and 4a/b)
% you must use the command below (and put the one above in comments).
% In other words, the 'oribib' option must be used for Deliverable 2
% but not for 3 and 4a/b.
% 
%
%\documentclass[runningheads,a4paper]{llncs}
%
%%%%% END OF 1st ADJUSTMENTS SECTION %%%%%

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}  %% needed for special characters (umlaut)
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{graphicx}     %% for graphical things such as including pictures

%%%%% BEGIN OF 2nd ADJUSTMENTS SECTION %%%%%
% Do NOT include an abstract in the outline and annotated bibliography
% (deliverable 2). For the full and final paper (deliverables 3 and 4a/b),
% you must uncomment the following two commands and place your text for
% the abstract in between them.
%
% \begin{abstract}
%   Here goes the actual text of your abstract.
% \end{abstract}
